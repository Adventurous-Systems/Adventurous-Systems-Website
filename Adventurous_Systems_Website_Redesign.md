# **PAGE 2: WHAT WE DO**

## **What We Do**

TAGLINE: We transform how the AEC industry coordinates data, proves outcomes, and builds sustainably.

### **Page Introduction**

For twenty years, we've researched computational design, blockchain integration, and digital coordination systems. That research now powers practical implementations for forward-thinking organizations.

Our services fall into four connected areas, each grounded in published methodology and validated through real projects.

## **SERVICE 1: DIGITAL TWIN INTEGRATION**

### **The Challenge**

Construction projects generate fragmented data across disconnected systems—BIM models, project management platforms, IoT sensors, financial software. This fragmentation costs the industry £54 billion annually in rework, delays, and lost insights.

### **Our Approach**

We design and implement digital twin architectures that create unified, queryable representations of built assets throughout their lifecycle. Our twins integrate:

• Building Information Models (BIM/IFC)  
• Real-time IoT sensor data  
• Satellite and geospatial information  
• Blockchain verification layers  
• Operational and maintenance systems

### **What Makes Ours Different**

#### ***Research-Validated Frameworks:***

Our methodology draws from published research in computational design and graph database theory, not vendor marketing.

#### ***Open Standards:***

We build on IFC, LBD (Linked Building Data), and open ontologies—no vendor lock-in.

#### ***Verifiable Provenance:***

Blockchain integration ensures every data point has cryptographically-verified history.

### **Outcomes**

• Single source of truth across project stakeholders  
• Automated compliance verification  
• Predictive maintenance through pattern recognition  
• Reduced rework through real-time coordination

### **Ideal For**

### **Blockchain-Enabled Circular Economy for Construction Materials**

**STATUS:** Active Pilot | Scotland Beyond Net Zero Funded  
**VALUE:** £101,000  
**TIMELINE:** 2024-2025

### **The Problem**

Construction generates 62% of UK waste while simultaneously extracting virgin materials. Reuse could significantly reduce both, but current systems lack the trust infrastructure to operate at scale. Builders can't verify material quality, sellers can't prove provenance, and transactions involve prohibitive friction.

### **Our Solution**

TRACE creates a blockchain-verified marketplace connecting demolition contractors, reuse hubs, and builders through digital material passports. Every material receives a cryptographically-signed identity containing:

• Origin and manufacturing data  
• Performance specifications and test results  
• Environmental product declarations  
• Handling and storage history  
• Quality certifications

Smart contracts automate payment upon verified delivery, and the distributed ledger ensures no single party can manipulate records.

### **Technical Architecture**

**• Blockchain Layer:** Ethereum-compatible smart contracts for material registration and transactions  
**• Data Standards:** Integration with BIM/IFC formats and materials databases  
**• Verification Protocol:** Multi-party consensus for quality assurance  
**• User Interface:** Web portal for material listing, search, and transaction management

### **Partners**

• Scottish Government (Beyond Net Zero programme)  
• Robert Gordon University  
• Stirling Reuse Hub  
• Demolition contractors (active material flows)  
• Construction firms (demand side)

### **Outcomes to Date**

• Live pilot with real material transactions  
• Blockchain-verified material passports operational  
• Framework for scaling across Scotland

## **PROJECT: DIGITAL TWIN BLOCKCHAIN PILOT**

\[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Digital twin visualization\]

### **Space- and Web3-Enabled Coordination for Verifiable Retrofit Delivery**

**STATUS:** Active Development  
**APPLICATION:** Energy efficiency retrofit programmes

### **The Challenge**

UK's retrofit programme aims to upgrade millions of homes, but current delivery models suffer from:

• Unverified contractor work quality  
• Disputed energy savings calculations  
• Payment delays pending manual inspection  
• Limited outcome accountability

### **Our Approach**

We combine satellite thermal imaging, IoT sensors, blockchain verification, and automated payment systems to create trustable retrofit delivery:

**1\. Pre-Retrofit Baseline:** Satellite thermal imaging establishes energy performance  
**2\. Installation Verification:** IoT sensors confirm work completion and specification compliance  
**3\. Performance Validation:** Continuous monitoring proves actual energy savings  
**4\. Automated Payment:** Smart contracts release funds upon verified milestones  
**5\. Carbon Accounting:** Blockchain-recorded savings create verifiable carbon credits

### **Technical Components**

• Satellite data integration (thermal imaging analysis)  
• IoT sensor networks (temperature, humidity, energy consumption)  
• Digital twin model (unified building representation)  
• Blockchain verification layer (immutable audit trail)  
• Smart contract automation (milestone-based payment)

### **Innovation**

This pilot demonstrates how spatial data, IoT, and blockchain can work together to solve the retrofit industry's trust deficit. By automating verification and payment, we reduce transaction costs and increase delivery confidence.

### **Current Status**

Technical architecture complete. Seeking pilot deployment properties and retrofit programme partners.

CTA: \[Discuss Pilot Partnership →\]

## **PROJECT: DEFAB \- DECENTRALISED FABRICATION PILOT**

\[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: 3D printing concept\]

### **Blockchain-Verified Additive Manufacturing for Construction**

**STATUS:** Discovery Phase  
**FOCUS:** Distributed 3D printing networks with verifiable provenance

### **The Vision**

Additive manufacturing promises localized, on-demand construction component production. But scaling requires solving provenance, quality assurance, and intellectual property challenges.

### **Our Approach**

DeFab explores blockchain-enabled distributed fabrication where:

• Designs are tokenized with IP protections  
• Print parameters are cryptographically verified  
• Material composition is blockchain-recorded  
• Quality control is automated through sensor verification  
• Local fabricators join a trusted network

### **Research Questions**

• Can blockchain solve IP protection in distributed manufacturing?  
• How do we verify print quality without centralized inspection?  
• What economic models sustain local fabrication networks?  
• How does this integrate with circular material flows?

### **Current Phase**

Literature review, technical architecture development, and partner identification.

### **Future Applications**

• Disaster relief (rapid, local fabrication)

• Circular material systems (distributed recycling-to-printing)  
• Mass customization (localized production at scale)

CTA: \[Join DeFab Discovery →\]

## **PROJECT: BLOCKCHAIN WEAVING \- CULTURAL HERITAGE PRESERVATION**

\[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Weaving pattern visualization\]

### **Encoding Traditional Craft Through Blockchain and Parametric Design**

**STATUS:** Concept Development  
**APPLICATION:** Al Sadu weaving heritage preservation

### **The Challenge**

Traditional weaving practices encode cultural knowledge that risks disappearing. Digital preservation typically creates static records—photographs or videos—that can't be interrogated, varied, or actively transmitted.

### **Our Approach**

We're exploring whether blockchain and parametric design can create "living" digital preservation:

• Weaving patterns encoded as parametric grammars  
• Variations minted as NFTs with lineage to traditional patterns  
• Blockchain-verified attribution to weavers and cultural origins  
• Generative systems that explore pattern spaces while maintaining cultural integrity  
• Economic models that value cultural knowledge

### **Technical Research**

• Shape grammar formalization of weaving patterns  
• Parametric systems for pattern variation  
• NFT frameworks for cultural attribution  
• Blockchain for provenance and royalty distribution

### **Cultural Considerations**

This project requires deep collaboration with cultural practitioners. Technology serves preservation and continuation, not extraction or appropriation.

### **Status**

Early-stage concept development. Seeking cultural partnerships and grant funding.

# **PAGE 4: ABOUT US**

## **About Us**

TAGLINE: Where academic innovation meets industry practice.

## **Our Story**

Adventurous Systems emerged from twenty years at the intersection of architecture, computational design, and emerging technology.

Since 2004, through Adventurous Architecture studio and academic positions across three continents, we've pursued a consistent question: How can advanced computation transform how we design, build, and operate the built environment?

Early research explored parametric design, digital fabrication, and shape grammars. By the mid-2010s, we recognized that computational design's real challenge wasn't form generation—it was data coordination across fragmented industry systems.

That realization led to deep research into graph databases, blockchain, and digital twins. We weren't interested in applying trendy technology for its own sake. We wanted to solve construction's fundamental problems: lack of trust, fragmented information, and inability to verify outcomes.

In 2022, we published "Blockchain for Construction" with Springer, synthesizing five years of research. By then, we'd secured competitive funding, built working prototypes, and established that these technologies could solve real problems.

Adventurous Systems formalized in 2023 to bridge our academic research and industry implementation. We remain deeply embedded in university research environments while actively deploying what we've validated.
